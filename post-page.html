    <h2 class="sub-heading">OYO STATE GOVERNMENT, OYO PTS RECEIVES 20 CNG BUSES FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.    </h2>
    <p class="post-text">As pacesetters and collaborators in sustainable development, the Governor Seyi Makinde led Oyo State Government via the Pacesetter Transport Services partners with the Presidential CNG Initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria to launch CNG vehicles in the State.</p>
    <p class="post-text">This is in fulfilment of the promise made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to ease the impact of fuel subsidy removal on Nigerians by reducing energy costs.</p>
    <!-- <h2 class="sub-heading">Create Best UX Design</h2> -->
    <p class="post-text">However, recall that the Seyi Makinde led Oyo State Government had earlier taken proactive measures in the same vein via the Sustainable Action for Economic Recovery(SAfER) Initiative in the State, which significantly led to the rejuvenation of the Oyo State Pacesetter Transport Services led by Hon. Dr. Salami Ibraheem DIKKO, and has since remarkably impacted the economic well being of commuters in the State.</p>
    <p class="post-text">The CNG buses are powered with cheaper, cleaner, safer and domestically produced natural gas, thus promoting a cleaner and healthier environment with lesser economic demand.</p>
    <p class="post-text">The launch was characterized by a brief handing over ceremony of the buses, and was graced by the Chairman and Sole Administrator of the Pacesetter Transport Services, Hon. Dr. Dikko Salami; the Chief Executive Officer/Program Director, PCNGi, Engr. Michael Oluwagbemi; the Chairman Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency(OYSROMA), Hon. Busoye Ogunlade; and the Special Assistant to the Governor of Oyo State on Environment, Engr. Adeola Aderinto, amongst others.</p>
