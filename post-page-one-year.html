    <h2 class="sub-heading">PTS MARKS ONE YEAR OF DIGITAL OPERATIONS.</p>
    <p class="post-text">Exactly a year ago, on the 24th September, 2023, the Pacesetter Transport Services launched the digital use of the Governor Seyi Makinde's OMITUNTUN BUSES serving as the subsidized transport service for the people in the State.</p>
    <!-- <h2 class="sub-heading">Create Best UX Design</h2> -->
    <p class="post-text">The digitalization came through the use of an electronic means of payment known as the Pacesetter Card whereby commuters only have to tap-in the card on a validating machine at the point of entry to board the bus.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Prior to this development, commuters and advocates of the sustainability of the SAfER initiative and the Pacesetter Transport Services at large, have lodged complaints about the possible unaccountability of the generated revenue considering past precedence. And Hon. Dr. Salami Ibraheem Oladeji DIKKO, being a leading example in the Governor Seyi Makinde's administration exhibited one of the fundamental characteristics of the administration by improving on the feedbacks, thus the Pacesetter Card was introduced.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Within weeks of introducing these cards, over 5,000 users were recorded, attesting that the good people of the State were pleased and welcomed the development.

        It's a year now, and it can only be better as the card has witnessed stages from FREE to PREMIUM with a massive record of now over 600,000 users in total.        
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Within this one year of digitalization also, E-ticketing has been introduced to complement the Pacesetter Card; ensuring accessibility to more commuters while still ensuring accountable revenue generation. The E-tickets serve as a one-time use in the absence of a Pacesetter Card to accommodate commuters who don't have the card while they are encouraged to get the Pacesetter Card for subsequent use.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">The digitalization has equally made way for several other benefits and development such as franchise for willing collaborators as Pacesetter Card Vendors.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">The "tap-as-you-go" Pacesetter Card have also helped to reduce to barest minimum, common conflicts between commuters and transporters usually borne out of cash transactions.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">
        Some of our commuters have also devised using the Pacesetter Card as their piggy for transportation expenses; saving their transportation budget on the Pacesetter Card.        
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">
        We use this opportunity to thank you for your usual cooperation, support, and continuous herald of these developments, and once again promise our unwavering commitment to quality services.
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">
        Cheers to more years of smart and seamless commuting.
    </p>
