        OYO PTS RECEIVES 20 CNG BUSES FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
        </a>
        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2022</span>
        <p class="post-decription">
            As pacesetters and collaborators in sustainable development, the Governor Seyi Makinde led Oyo State Government via the Pacesetter Transport Services partners with the Presidential CNG Initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria to launch CNG vehicles in the State.
            This is in fulfilment of the promise made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to ease the impact of fuel subsidy removal on Nigerians by reducing energy costs.
            However, recall that the Seyi Makinde led Oyo State Government had earlier taken proactive measures in the same vein via the Sustainable Action for Economic Recovery(SAfER) Initiative in the State, which significantly led to the rejuvenation of the Oyo State Pacesetter Transport Services led by Hon. Dr. Salami Ibraheem DIKKO, and has since remarkably impacted the economic well being of commuters in the State.
            In continued advancement towards excellence and sustainability as evident in the operations of the Oyo State Pacesetter Transport Services, it becomes expedient to key into the Presidential CNGi of the Federal Government, and on Monday, the State through the Company received 20 CNG buses from the Federal Government of Nigeria to support the economic recovery process.
            The CNG buses are powered with cheaper, cleaner, safer and domestically produced natural gas, thus promoting a cleaner and healthier environment with lesser economic demand.
            The launch was characterized by a brief handing over ceremony of the buses, and was graced by the Chairman and Sole Administrator of the Pacesetter Transport Services, Hon. Dr. Dikko Salami; the Chief Executive Officer/Program Director, PCNGi, Engr. Michael Oluwagbemi; the Chairman Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency(OYSROMA), Hon. Busoye Ogunlade; and the Special Assistant to the Governor of Oyo State on Environment, Engr. Adeola Aderinto, amongst others.</p>

        </a>
        <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2024</span>
        <p class="post-decription">The Pacesetter Transport Services wins the Mobility Company of the Year Award at the just concluded Ibadan Tech Expo, 24 Awards.

            The award ceremony which is regarded as the biggest tech event in the Capital City of Oyo State, Ibadan was held on Saturday, 28th September, 2024 at the International Conference Centre(ICC), University of Ibadan, hosting dignitaries, tech experts and enthusiasts across the State and beyond.

            The Chairman and Sole Administrator of the Pacesetter Transport Services, Hon. Dr. Salami Ibraheem Oladeji DIKKO dedicates the award to the Governor of the State, His Excellency, Engr. Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde.

            PTS MARKS ONE YEAR OF DIGITAL OPERATIONS.
        </a>
        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2022</span>
        <p class="post-decription">Exactly a year ago, on the 24th September, 2023, the Pacesetter Transport Services launched the digital use of the Governor Seyi Makinde's OMITUNTUN BUSES serving as the subsidized transport service for the people in the State.
            The digitalization came through the use of an electronic means of payment known as the Pacesetter Card whereby commuters only have to tap-in the card on a validating machine at the point of entry to board the bus.
            Prior to this development, commuters and advocates of the sustainability of the SAfER initiative and the Pacesetter Transport Services at large, have lodged complaints about the possible unaccountability of the generated revenue considering past precedence. And Hon. Dr. Salami Ibraheem Oladeji DIKKO, being a leading example in the Governor Seyi Makinde's administration exhibited one of the fundamental characteristics of the administration by improving on the feedbacks, thus the Pacesetter Card was introduced.
            Within weeks of introducing these cards, over 5,000 users were recorded, attesting that the good people of the State were pleased and welcomed the development.
            It's a year now, and it can only be better as the card has witnessed stages from FREE to PREMIUM with a massive record of now over 600,000 users in total.
            Within this one year of digitalization also, E-ticketing has been introduced to complement the Pacesetter Card; ensuring accessibility to more commuters while still ensuring accountable revenue generation. The E-tickets serve as a one-time use in the absence of a Pacesetter Card to accommodate commuters who don't have the card while they are encouraged to get the Pacesetter Card for subsequent use.
            
            The digitalization has equally made way for several other benefits and development such as franchise for willing collaborators as Pacesetter Card Vendors.
            
            The "tap-as-you-go" Pacesetter Card have also helped to reduce to barest minimum, common conflicts between commuters and transporters usually borne out of cash transactions.
            
            Some of our commuters have also devised using the Pacesetter Card as their piggy for transportation expenses; saving their transportation budget on the Pacesetter Card.
            
            We use this opportunity to thank you for your usual cooperation, support, and continuous herald of these developments, and once again promise our unwavering commitment to quality services.
            
            Cheers to more years of smart and seamless commuting.</p>
